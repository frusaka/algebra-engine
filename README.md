# Algebra Engine ðŸ§®

An educational software built in Python for manipulating algebraic expressions.
Supports rational simplification, polynomial manipulation, factoring, root finding, equation solving, and many more!

âœ… Tree-based expression evaluation  
âœ… Designed to match Algebra II and Pre-Calc workflows  
ðŸš« (Trigonometric and exponential solving planned)

## âœ¨ Features

- [x] Expression parser
- [x] GCD/LCM computation (numeric and symbolic)
- [x] Exact numeric radical representation
- [x] Expansion and Factoring (numeric and symbolic, univariates & multivariates alike)
- [x] Solving linear and polynomial systems
- [x] Solving equations and inequalities with domain analysis
- [x] Verbose equation transformation steps with Custom pretty-printer (`LaTeX` + `HTML` or python rich library in terminal)
- [ ] Exponential equations and trig

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/frusaka/algebra-engine.git
   cd algebra-engine
   ```
2. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Try it:

   - REPL (Does not support function calls, e.g simplify(expr))
     ```bash
     python terminal.py
     ```
   - Or start the GUI (Recommended âœ…)

     ```bash
     python main.py

     ```

4. If you want it to run without internet connection:  
   First, make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed correctly.  
   Then in the terminal, run
   ```bash
   .\prepare-lib.sh
   python main.py
   ```
