1. Streamline the process of operations between terms and non-terms (not urgent)
    e.g:
        3-(x=5)
        5(x=5)
2. Handle nested (in)equalities
3. Improve solving for inequalities (sign and extraneous solutions check)
4. Some valid results get rejected when checking for extraneous solutions due to rooting a Polynomial.
    Add a way to smartly control strictness, or check if a Polynomial has a perfect power
5. Improve multiplication of Products containing Polynomials
6. Fix appearance of unnecessarily large Polynomials
    ((x-y)/(x+y))^2 + ((x+y)/(x-y))^2 (add to tests)
7. Lookout for string based substitution.
    In case of small decimals, the output string may not be perfectly precise,
    Or in scientific notation
8. Improve ratio operator output and add related tests
