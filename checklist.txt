1. Some valid results get rejected when checking for extraneous solutions due to rooting a Polynomial.
    Add a way to smartly control strictness, or check if a Polynomial has a perfect power
    e.g x -> x^2 - 5x + 2âˆš(y^2 - 10y + 25) = y - 5
2. Improve multiplication of Products containing Polynomials
3. Improve ratio operator output and add related tests
4. Add simplification for cases such as:
    3x/(x^3 + 6x^2)
5. Enhace Systems solver for edge cases
6. Fails: (4y+3/(x+5))^2
