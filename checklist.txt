1. Some valid results get rejected when checking for extraneous solutions due to rooting a Polynomial.
    Add a way to smartly control strictness, or check if a Polynomial has a perfect power
2. Improve multiplication of Products containing Polynomials
3. Lookout for string based substitution.
    In case of small decimals, the output string may not be perfectly precise,
    Or in scientific notation
4. Improve ratio operator output and add related tests
5. Add simplification for cases such as:
    3x/(x^3 + 6x^2)
6. Implement Polynomial division without cancelling common terms
7. Improve printing of System class
8. Make Systems solver consider equations by difficulty
8. Enhace Systems solver for inequalities and edge cases
