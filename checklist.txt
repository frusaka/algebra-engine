1. Streamline the process of operations between terms and non-terms (not urgent)
    e.g:
        3-(x=5)
        5(x=5)
2. Handle nested (in)equalities
3. Improve solving for inequalities (sign and extraneous solutions check)
4. Some valid results get rejected when checking for extraneous solutions due to rooting a Polynomial.
    Add a way to smartly control strictness, or check if a Polynomial has a perfect power
5. Improve multiplication of Products containing Polynomials
