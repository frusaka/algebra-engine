1. Return boolean outputs for Numeric only comparisons
2. Improve multiplication of Polynomial Rationals
4. Add simplification for cases such as:
    3x/(x^3 + 6x^2)
    (x^2-4)^0.5/(x+2)^0.5
    (x+4)^0.5*x^0.5
    2/(x^2-4)^0.5 + f/(x+2)^0.5
5. Make solver iterative
6. Improve solving by factorizaiton
7. Add saftey checks when solving for nested radicals or complex equations
8. enhance equation difficulty weighing
9. Bring back dem mixed fractions
10. h -> S=2pr^2+2pr^2h : Failing, simplification error (S-2pr)/2pr^2 * pr^2
