1. Streamline the process of operations between terms and non-terms (not urgent)
    e.g:
        3-(x=5)
        5(x=5)
2. Revise long division to support super simplification of remainders
    e.g, (3+(x-3)/(x-3)^2) => (3+1/(x-3))
    NOTE: This would properly simplify to the expected output, but long division can return such a result
3. Improve consistency and watch for recursion explosion
4. Fix plus-minus solutions for inequalities
5. Refactor and document project after merging
