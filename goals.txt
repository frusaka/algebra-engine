1. Check for extreneous solutions
2. Gracefully handle no solutions or infinite solutions
3. Streamline the process of operations between terms and non-terms (not urgent)
    e.g:
        3-(x=5)
        5(x=5)
    Perhaps by adding a superclass to supervise operations
    This should also check for limits
        e.g:
            (2x=3)(5x-4=y)
4. Revise long division to support super simplification of remainders
    e.g, (3+(x-3)/(x-3)^2) => (3+1/(x-3))
    NOTE: This would properly simplify to the expected output, but long division can return such a result
5. Improve consistency and watch for recursion explosion
